# Miau Suika
Miau Suika is a Suika Game around cats. This game was developed by Anna-Maria (Art&Animation) and Wanyufo (Programming) during a 4-Day private gamejam.

Special thanks to Riventropy for kindly letting us use their soundtracks for the game.

We hope you have fun playing our cozy-cute Miau Suika!
